# Distributed version of the Spring PetClinic Sample Application hosted on K8s with Istio Service Mesh

This project is fork from [Spring PetClinic Microservice project](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) to demonstrate how to use Istio Service Mesh on Kubernetes. While running on Kubernetes, some components (such as Spring Cloud Config and Eureka Service Discovery) are removed.

The work on this project is in progress...
